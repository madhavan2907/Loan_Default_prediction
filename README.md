# Loan_Default_prediction

In this project, I've built a classification model to predict the probability of default value for a customer based on his credit history and deployed the same as a webapp in Heroku.

### Note :  
Exports of intermittant transformation steps, will be cleared at the end the model execution.
### Steps to follow:
1. Create a new folder at a location of your choice
2. Download below files from Model folder to the folder created in step-1:  
	a. EDA_and_Data_Engineering.ipynb  
	b. Modelling.ipynb  
	c. XYZCorp_LendingData.rar  
3. Unzip the XYZCorp_LendingData.rar file to the same directory.
4. Open jupyter notebook and execute the notebook : EDA_and_Data_Engineering.ipynb, Wait till all the cells are executed sucessfully without any issues.
5. Now execute the notebook : Modelling.ipynb and Wait till all the cells are executed sucessfully without any issues.
